# Customer-Segmentation-Engine
Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers by common characteristics. 
It is done to improve the decision making in business. Unsupervised ML technique called KMeans Clustering will be used. 
Unsupervised ML is used to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. It is used to discover hidden patterns or data grouping.
The Goal of KMeans algorithm is to group the data into clusters that are distinct from other clusters i.e. each and every data in present in the same cluster is related to each other as well as it is non-related to data present in other clusters.
