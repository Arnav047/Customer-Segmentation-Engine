# Customer-Segmentation-Engine

## About Project
* Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers by common characteristics. 
It is done to improve the decision making in business. Unsupervised ML technique called KMeans Clustering will be used. 
* Unsupervised ML is used to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. It is used to discover hidden patterns or data grouping.
* The Goal of KMeans algorithm is to group the data into clusters that are distinct from other clusters i.e. each and every data in present in the same cluster is related to each other as well as it is non-related to data present in other clusters.


## Problem Statement/Opportunity
* Customer Segmentation Engine can be used by many IT companies like Amazon, Google, etc., or other businesses to group their customers based on the same characteristics and Improve the decision-making in business for the best marketing strategies.


## Azure Services and Visualization tool used in this project:
* Azure Machine Learning
* Power BI


### Azure Machine Learning

* Azure Machine Learning is for individuals and teams implementing MLOps within their organization to bring machine learning models into production in a secure and auditable production environment.

* Machine learning (ML) is the process of using mathematical models of data to help a computer learn without direct instruction. It’s considered a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning uses algorithms to identify patterns within data and those patterns are then used to create a data model that can make predictions. With increased data and experience, the results of machine learning are more accurate—much like how humans improve with more practice.

* The adaptability of machine learning makes it a great choice in scenarios where the data is always changing, the nature of the request or task are always shifting, or coding a solution would be effectively impossible.


### Power BI

* Power BI is used to connect to and visualize any data using the unified, scalable platform for self-service and enterprise business intelligence (BI) that’s easy to use and helps us gain deeper data insight. It is used to create amazing data experiences, easily connect to, model, and visualize our data, creating memorable reports personalized with your KPIs and brand. Get fast, AI-powered answers to our business questions—even when asking with conversational language.

* It is used to gain insight from your largest BI deployments, make the most of oour big data investments by connecting to all our data sources with the scale to analyze, share, and promote insights across our organization while maintaining data accuracy, consistency, and security.

* It is used to make decisions with confidence, work together easily on the same data, collaborate on reports, and share insights across popular Microsoft Office applications such as Microsoft Teams and Excel—empowering everyone in oour organization to quickly make data-driven decisions that drive strategic actions.
